            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <p>Hi everybody. I am Tirani Ayuningtias, a student at Maritime Raja Ali Haji University majoring in accounting.
at the moment I am following independent studies at infinite learning batch 4. I chose the web development program because I am interested in learning digital-based things and I want to know what is learned to become a web developer. Being able to be a part of Infinite Learning Batch 4 is a very proud experience and for sure I get a lot of new things that I have never learned before. Of course I will not waste this opportunity!.
And this is the first time I have jumped into learning about the digital world, and this is the first website that I made, my friends. although there are still many shortcomings but I feel proud because I could do it.</p>
